    OSWALD. [From within.] No, thank you. I think I shall go out a little.
<br>
MRS. ALVING. Yes, do. The weather seems a little brighter now. [She
shuts the dining-room door, goes to the hall door, and calls:] Regina!
<br>
REGINA. [Outside.] Yes, Mrs. Alving?
<br>
MRS. ALVING. Go down to the laundry, and help with the garlands.
<br>
REGINA. Yes, Mrs. Alving.
<br>
[MRS. ALVING assures herself that REGINA goes; then shuts the door.]
<br>
MANDERS. I suppose he cannot overhear us in there?
<br>
MRS. ALVING. Not when the door is shut. Besides, he's just going out.
